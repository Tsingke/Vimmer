# Vimmer: Easily manage your Vim plugins #

Vimmer makes it easy to install, remove and update Vim plugins from the following sources:

- Github
- Vim.org

N.B. Vimmer is a work in progress. This is an early alpha release for those who are willing to try it and submit feedback. I am offering it with NO GUARANTEES. If you're still with me, please submit your feedback at [https://github.com/densitypop/Vimmer/issues](https://github.com/densitypop/Vimmer/issues). Thank you!

## Installation and Usage ##

Installing Vimmer is as simple as running:

    gem install vimmer

### Dependencies ###

Vimmer depends on the Pathogen plugin for managing Vim's runtime path. Using Pathogen, Vimmer will install plugins into ~/.vim/bundle. Installing a plugin is as simple as running:

    vimmer install https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git

To install a plugin, colorscheme or other script from vim.org use the URL to the script's page. For example:

    vimmer install "http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501"

Restart Vim and you're done! For details on installing Pathogen see [Pathogen on Vim.org](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332). Note: I am planning to automatically setup Pathogen during the Vimmer install process.

### Documentation ###

Vimmer is documented using Cucumber features and hosted on [Relish](http://www.relishapp.com). [View the documentation.](http://relishapp.com/joefiorini/vimmer)
