## Documentation

Vimmer is documented using the [Cucumber BDD framework](http://cukes.info). Cucumber gives us executable documentation, which for you means that as long as I keep my tests passing it will never be out of date.

## Issues

The documentation for Vimmer is a work in progress. We'll be adding
Cucumber features over time and clarifying existing ones.  If you have
specific features you'd like to see added, find the existing documentation
incomplete or confusing or, better yet, wish to write a missing Cucumber
feature yourself, please [submit an
issue](http://github.com/densitypop/vimmer/issues) or a [pull
request](http://github.com/densitypop/vimmer).
